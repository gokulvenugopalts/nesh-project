Project: Neshtics
Abstract: A web app that presents stats, news and related information of a company that can be used for analytical studies on the company.
Description: Neshtics is a webapp that gets a user input(keyword or a ticker) which is searched on Motley-fool website to fetch information.
	This information include company profile, stock details, news and finances.
	This app is a two page applicaiton. First page serves the functionality of searching. Also, provides user some suggestion of tending
	companies. The second page is the company portfolio where all the necessary information are presented. It also features search 
	functionality and links to various news/company websites.
	This app is built on Pyton and HTML. I used Flask to communicate python to HTML.

Note: Though the application is not finished, I have included the design to get the picture of final website.
